Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on docs.github.com âœ¨.

Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Types of Contributions

**To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md).**

*Any kind of contribution that is not listed here we do NOT accept*

### Issues
[Issues](https://github.com/Leo-Wolff/SandScript/issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a template. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

If you have any ideas or wish to begin any discussion about the project, feel free to create an issue under the `question` label.

### Pull requests
A [pull request](https://github.com/Leo-Wolff/SandScript/pulls) is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours.

### Support
We are a small team working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a continuously changing product. Unfortunately, we just can't help with support questions in this repository. If you are experiencing a problem with SandScript, unrelated to our documentation, please contact our community leaders at leo.kramer@hva.nl directly. Any issues, discussions, or pull requests opened here requesting support will be given information about how to contact GitHub Support, then closed and locked.
